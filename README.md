Exploring data from a study on the mental health of international students to  find out which factors may have the greatest impact.

Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? 
In this project i leverage my data manipulation skills to explore the data from a study on the mental health of international students,so as to find out which factors may have the greatest impact.
A published study on Japanese international University found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

**Approach:**
In this project, I aim to explore the students' data using PostgreSQL to find out if international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.

**Key Insights:**
The length of stay impacts the average diagnostic scores for international students. we can observe that the average scores start high within 1 year of stay and it increases as they extend their stay for another year or so.
We can also observe the score for social connectedness is lower when the students have stayed for 10 years than all the other years of their stay.

**Inference:**
We can conclude that going to university in a different country affects your mental health.
From our above analysis, we can conclude international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.
